Warning: React does not recognize the `dataName` prop on a DOM element.
- This warning comes from an imported icon from react-icons that i can not fix

Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of `Recipes`.
- I cant find the root of this warning, the list-children rendered in this component all have the key-prop.
